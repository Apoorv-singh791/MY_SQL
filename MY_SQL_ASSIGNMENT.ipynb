A primary key ensures that there are no duplicate values in the column or columns and that every record has a value in the column or columns. A table can have only one primary key, which is usually defined at the time of creating the table. For example, CREATE TABLE students (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), age INT); creates a table called students with a primary key on the id column.                                                                                   \n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns that refers to the primary key of another table. A foreign key creates a link between two tables and ensures that the values in the referencing column or columns match the values in the referenced column or columns. A table can have multiple foreign keys, which are usually defined after creating the table using the ALTER TABLE statement. For example, ALTER TABLE orders ADD FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id); adds a foreign key on the customer_id column of the orders table that references the id column of the customers table."
